## Availibility
- MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)

### General Scenario

### Tactics

### Design checklist
*TODO*


## Interoperability
- Exchange meaningful information
- More meaningfulness > More header > Heavy packet > Less exchange rate vs. High exchange rate â€” Tradeoff
- System of systems(SoS): A group of systems that are interoperating to achieve a joint purpose.
	- Directed: Strict Centralized management
	- Acknowledged: Centralized management + self-management.
	- Collaborative: Systems voluntarily work tog.ether
	- Virtual: Systems don't know about each other
- SOAP vs REST: Simple Object Access Protocol / Representation State Transfer

### General Scenario

### Tactics

- Locate
	- Discover service: Service registry
- Manage Interfaces
	- Orchestrate: Uses a control mechanism. Is used when systems have complex interacts & complex tasks. Workflow engines/mediator design pattern/language such as BPEL.
	- Tailor interface: adds or removes capabilities to an interface. decorator pattern

## Performace
- throughput (speed)
- efficiency (utilization)

## Security
- Prevent data and info from unauthorized access.
- Provide access to authorized system and people.
- CIA
	- Confidentiality
	- Integrity
	- Acailability

## Testability
- 30/50% of the cost of developing well-engineered systems.
- Testable if it "gives up" its faults easily

### General Scenario

### Design checklist
*TODO*



## Usability
- How easy the user accomplish a desired task
- Learning system features: fast learning curve
- Using a system efficiently
- Minimizing the impact of [user] errors
- Adapting the system to user needs
- Increasing confidence and satisfaction
