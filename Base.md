# Base

## Architectural Elements
- **Module**
	- models static representation of system
	- Code or data units
	- classes, layers, merely divisions of functionality
- **Component-and-connector**
	- models dynamic representation of system
	- component: runtime behavior
	- connector: interactions
	- services, peers, clients, servers, filters
- **Allocation**
	- how the system will relate to non-software structures
	- processor, directories or files, development teams

## Good Architecture
- There is **no such thing**, either more or less fit for some purpose.
- eg. high modifiability does not make sense for a throwaway prototype.
- can be evaluated but only in the **context** of specific stated goals.
